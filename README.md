Cerebellum robotics library
======================

Cerebellum library is a bunch of source code for MCUs, which contains frequently-used utilities like servo controller, chassis etc.

Cerebellum library is designed for usage with Antares buildsystem: https://github.com/nekromant/antares .

We plan to implement this stuff for AVR and STM32 microcontrollers. Main conception is to use most hardware feautres of MCU, but implement the same API for each arch.
